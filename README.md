AI Research Agent with ReAct, Web Search, and Citation Capabilites

This project is created as an assignment of ITAI-2376 Course. The AI Agent has Web Search,ReAct, and Citation capabilities. It uses Azure AI Foundry as its base technology and after the project is deployed to the Microsoft Cloud, we used API Key to connect from Google Colab to create the Agent from scratch. It also uses SerpAPI as its main resource of web search tool alongside DuckDuckGo.

## Steps to Build
1. Go to Microsoft Azure Portal and create a student account
2. Go to Azure AI Foundry to create your first deployment and create your agent, save the API key.
3. Create a free SerpAPI plan and save the API key.
4. Download the Final_Agent.ipynb file and open it in Google Colab.
5. Paste your API keys in the necessary lines between ""
6. Ask the Agent a question inside the main loop at the very end of the code.
7. Here you go! You have your AI Research Agent Tool to go through web and cite the findings for you!
