This project is created as an assignment of ITAI-2376 Course. The AI Agent has Web Search,ReAct, and Citation capabilities. It uses Azure AI Foundry as its base technology and after the project is deployed to the Microsoft Cloud, we used API Key to connect from Google Colab to create the Agent from scratch. It also uses SerpAPI as its main resource of web search tool alongside DuckDuckGo.
